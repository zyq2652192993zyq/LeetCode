----

We have a wooden plank of the length `n` **units**. Some ants are walking on the plank, each ant moves with speed **1 unit per second**. Some of the ants move to the **left**, the other move to the **right**.

When two ants moving in two **different** directions meet at some point, they change their directions and continue moving again. Assume changing directions doesn't take any additional time.

When an ant reaches **one end** of the plank at a time `t`, it falls out of the plank imediately.

Given an integer `n` and two integer arrays `left` and `right`, the positions of the ants moving to the left and the right. Return *the moment* when the last ant(s) fall out of the plank.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 4, left = [4,3], right = [0,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: In the image above:
-The ant at index 0 is named A and going to the right.
-The ant at index 1 is named B and going to the right.
-The ant at index 3 is named C and going to the left.
-The ant at index 4 is named D and going to the left.
Note that the last moment when an ant was on the plank is t = 4 second, after that it falls imediately out of the plank. (i.e. We can say that at t = 4.0000000001, there is no ants on the plank).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 7, left = [], right = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: 7
Explanation: All ants are going to the right, the ant at index 0 needs 7 seconds to fall.
```

**Example 3:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/17/ants3.jpg)

```
Input: n = 7, left = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7], right = []
Output: 7
Explanation: All ants are going to the left, the ant at index 7 needs 7 seconds to fall.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: n = 9, left = [5], right = [4]
Output: 5
Explanation: At t = 1 second, both ants will be at the same intial position but with different direction.
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: n = 6, left = [6], right = [0]
Output: 6
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10^4`
- `0 <= left.length <= n + 1`
- `0 <= left[i] <= n`
- `0 <= right.length <= n + 1`
- `0 <= right[i] <= n`
- `1 <= left.length + right.length <= n + 1`
- All values of `left` and `right` are unique, and each value can appear **only in one** of the two arrays.

这道题实际上就是《挑战程序设计竞赛》1.6轻松热身的例题，POJ-1852 Ants。蚂蚁碰撞后朝各自的反向向走，等效的结果是两只蚂蚁错开，不改变方向继续走。相比于POJ的题目，本题属于简化形式，给出了`left`和`right`，明确了每只蚂蚁的初始行走方向，那么初始向左走的蚂蚁，最后掉落的为距离右端点最远的蚂蚁，也就是`n - min(left)`；初始向右走的蚂蚁，最后掉落的为距离左端点最远的蚂蚁，也就是`max(right)`。

只需遍历一遍`left`和`right`数组，时间复杂度$O(n)$。

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int getLastMoment(int n, vector<int>& left, vector<int>& right) {
    	std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
		cin.tie(NULL);
		cout.tie(NULL);

		int maxVal = 0;
		for (auto & e : left) maxVal = max(maxVal, e);
		for (auto & e : right) maxVal = max(maxVal, n - e);

		return maxVal;
    }
};
```
