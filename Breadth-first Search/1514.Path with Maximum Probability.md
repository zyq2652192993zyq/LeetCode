-----

You are given an undirected weighted graph of `n` nodes (0-indexed), represented by an edge list where `edges[i] = [a, b]` is an undirected edge connecting the nodes `a` and `b` with a probability of success of traversing that edge `succProb[i]`.

Given two nodes `start` and `end`, find the path with the maximum probability of success to go from `start` to `end` and return its success probability.

If there is no path from `start` to `end`, **return 0**. Your answer will be accepted if it differs from the correct answer by at most **1e-5**.

 

**Example 1:**

**![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/20/1558_ex1.png)**

```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,2]], succProb = [0.5,0.5,0.2], start = 0, end = 2
Output: 0.25000
Explanation: There are two paths from start to end, one having a probability of success = 0.2 and the other has 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.
```

**Example 2:**

**![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/20/1558_ex2.png)**

```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,2]], succProb = [0.5,0.5,0.3], start = 0, end = 2
Output: 0.30000
```

**Example 3:**

**![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/20/1558_ex3.png)**

```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1]], succProb = [0.5], start = 0, end = 2
Output: 0.00000
Explanation: There is no path between 0 and 2.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 10^4`
- `0 <= start, end < n`
- `start != end`
- `0 <= a, b < n`
- `a != b`
- `0 <= succProb.length == edges.length <= 2*10^4`
- `0 <= succProb[i] <= 1`
- There is at most one edge between every two nodes.

------

从`start`开始，依次去更新与其相连的点，这些点作为源点再去更新其他点，数组`d[i]`记录从`start`到`i`的最大概率乘积，很典型的BFS套路。

这道题其实是边权重的最大乘积的一种形式，此时边的权重是以概率的形式表示，如果是权重大于1的数，甚至很大，最后结果超过了`unsigned long long`呢？其实可以将边的权重取`log`，然后用一个`path`数组来记录路径，这样就将乘积转化为加法了。当然本题无需这么做也可以求解。

```c++
class Solution {
	struct Node
	{
		int to;
		double probability;
		Node(int t, double p) : to(t), probability(p) {}
	};

public:
    double maxProbability(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<double>& succProb, int start, int end) {
        std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
        cin.tie(NULL);
        cout.tie(NULL);

        vector<vector<Node>> grid(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < edges.size(); ++i) {
        	int from = edges[i][0], to = edges[i][1];
        	grid[from].push_back(Node(to, succProb[i]));
        	grid[to].push_back(Node(from, succProb[i]));
        }

        vector<double> d(n, 0); d[start] = 1;
        queue<int> q;
        q.push(start);

        while (!q.empty()) {
        	int from = q.front(); q.pop();
        	for (int i = 0; i < grid[from].size(); ++i) {
        		int to = grid[from][i].to;
        		double probability = grid[from][i].probability;
        		if (d[to] < d[from] * probability) {
        			q.push(to);
        			d[to] = d[from] * probability;
        		}
        	}
        }

        return d[end];
    }
};
