-------

Given an array of citations **sorted in ascending order** (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): "A scientist has index *h* if *h* of his/her *N* papers have **at least** *h* citations each, and the other *N − h* papers have **no more than** *h* citations each."

**Example:**

```
Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
```

**Note:**

If there are several possible values for *h*, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

**Follow up:**

- This is a follow up problem to [H-Index](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/description/), where `citations` is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
- Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?

| 下标`i`        | 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    |
| -------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `citations[i]` | 0    | 1    | 3    | 5    | 6    |
| `n - i`        | 5    | 4    | 3    | 2    | 1    |

根据上面的表格，很容易知道去寻找第一个满足`citations[i] >= n - i`的下标`i`，然后结果就是`n-i`，数组内全是0的情况单独考虑，常数空间，时间复杂度$O(\log n)$。

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        int n = citations.size();
        if(n == 0 || citations[n - 1] == 0) return 0;
        int left = 0,right = n - 1;
        while(left < right)
        {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;
            if(citations[mid] >= n - mid) right = mid;
            else left = mid + 1;
        }
        return n - left;
    }
};
```
