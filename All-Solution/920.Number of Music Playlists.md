# 920. Number of Music Playlists
tags: `hard` `dynamic programming`
links: https://leetcode.cn/problems/number-of-music-playlists/description/

----

Your music player contains n different songs. You want to listen to goal songs (not necessarily different) during your trip. To avoid boredom, you will create a playlist so that:

Every song is played at least once.
A song can only be played again only if k other songs have been played.
Given n, goal, and k, return the number of possible playlists that you can create. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 3, goal = 3, k = 1
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 possible playlists: [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], and [3, 2, 1].
Example 2:

Input: n = 2, goal = 3, k = 0
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 possible playlists: [1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 1], [2, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2], and [1, 2, 2].
Example 3:

Input: n = 2, goal = 3, k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 possible playlists: [1, 2, 1] and [2, 1, 2].
 

Constraints:

0 <= k < n <= goal <= 100

用`d[i][j]`表示总共需要播放`i`首歌曲，目前已经播放了`j`首的方案数。对于第`i`首播放的歌曲，可以和前面的`j`首重复，也可以不重复。
假设不重复，则可选的范围为`n - (j - 1)`，$d[i][j] = d[i - 1][j - 1] \times (n - j + 1)$
如果重复，则会受到`k`的限制，只有目前播放的`j`首已经超过了`k`的限制，才可以播放重复的歌曲，所以$d[i][j] = d[i - 1][j] * \max{0, j - k}$

```java
class Solution {
    public int numMusicPlaylists(int n, int goal, int k) {
        long[][] d = new long[goal + 1][n + 1];
        d[0][0] = 1;
        final long MODE = (long)1e9 + 7;

        for (int i = 1; i <= goal; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
                d[i][j] = (d[i][j] + d[i - 1][j - 1] * (n - j + 1)) % MODE;
                d[i][j] = (d[i][j] + d[i - 1][j] * Math.max(0, j - k)) % MODE;
            }
        }

        return (long)d[goal][n];
    }
}
```
