----

Every non-negative integer `N` has a binary representation. For example, `5` can be represented as `"101"` in binary, `11` as `"1011"` in binary, and so on. Note that except for `N = 0`, there are no leading zeroes in any binary representation.

The *complement* of a binary representation is the number in binary you get when changing every `1` to a `0` and `0` to a `1`. For example, the complement of `"101"` in binary is `"010"` in binary.

For a given number `N` in base-10, return the complement of it's binary representation as a base-10 integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 5 is "101" in binary, with complement "010" in binary, which is 2 in base-10.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 7
Output: 0
Explanation: 7 is "111" in binary, with complement "000" in binary, which is 0 in base-10.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: 10
Output: 5
Explanation: 10 is "1010" in binary, with complement "0101" in binary, which is 5 in base-10.
```

**Note:**

1. `0 <= N < 10^9`
2. This question is the same as 476: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int bitwiseComplement(int N) {
        std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
        cin.tie(NULL);
        cout.tie(NULL);

        if (N == 0) return 1;

        unsigned int mask = INT_MAX;
        while (mask & N) mask <<= 1;

        return (~N) & (~mask);
    }
};
```

按位取反很自然的联想到运算符`~`，但是如果能够固定数量的按位取反，其实可以考虑利用`INT_MAX`的移位操作，不断左移，直到和`num`的与运算为0，那么就可以确定需要按位取反的有多少位了，注意存在输入为0的情形。另外要用`unsigned int`类型。
