-----

Given a string `S`, consider all *duplicated substrings*: (contiguous) substrings of S that occur 2 or more times. (The occurrences may overlap.)

Return **any** duplicated substring that has the longest possible length. (If `S` does not have a duplicated substring, the answer is `""`.)

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "banana"
Output: "ana"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "abcd"
Output: ""
```

**Note:**

1. `2 <= S.length <= 10^5`
2. `S` consists of lowercase English letters.
