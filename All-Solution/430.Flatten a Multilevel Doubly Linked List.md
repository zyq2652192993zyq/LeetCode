------

You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers, it could have a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure, as shown in the example below.

Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the list.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]
Output: [1,2,3,7,8,11,12,9,10,4,5,6]
Explanation:

The multilevel linked list in the input is as follows:



After flattening the multilevel linked list it becomes:
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,null,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
Explanation:

The input multilevel linked list is as follows:

  1---2---NULL
  |
  3---NULL
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

**How multilevel linked list is represented in test case:**

We use the multilevel linked list from **Example 1** above:

```
 1---2---3---4---5---6--NULL
         |
         7---8---9---10--NULL
             |
             11--12--NULL
```

The serialization of each level is as follows:

```
[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[7,8,9,10,null]
[11,12,null]
```

To serialize all levels together we will add nulls in each level to signify no node connects to the upper node of the previous level. The serialization becomes:

```
[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[null,null,7,8,9,10,null]
[null,11,12,null]
```

Merging the serialization of each level and removing trailing nulls we obtain:

```
[1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]
```

**Constraints:**

- Number of Nodes will not exceed 1000.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 10^5`

------

很明显对于某个节点存在`child`的时候，利用递归去展开子节点，假设某个`child`展开的结果是`front`，我们还需要一个指针指向尾节点，先当与把一段用`front`和 `end`给包含起来。注意一个点，当访问`head -> next`的时候，一定要注意检验其是否存在，如果不存在就不需要建立`prev`指针了。

所有节点最多遍历两次，时间复杂度$O(n)$。

```c++
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    Node* prev;
    Node* next;
    Node* child;
};
*/

class Solution {
public:
    Node* flatten(Node* head) {
        std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
        cin.tie(NULL);
        cout.tie(NULL);

        if (!head) return NULL;

        Node * dummy = new Node(-1);
        dummy -> next = head;

        while (head) {
            if (head -> child) {
                Node * front = flatten(head -> child);
                Node * end = getEnd(front);
                head -> child = NULL;

                if (head -> next) head -> next -> prev = end;
                end -> next = head -> next;
                head -> next = front;
                front -> prev = head;
                head = end -> next;
            }
            else {
                head = head -> next;
            }
        }

        Node *res = dummy -> next;
        delete dummy; dummy = NULL;

        return res;
    }

    Node *getEnd(Node *head)
    {
        if (!head) return NULL;

        while (head -> next) {
            head = head -> next;
        }

        return head;
    }
};
```
