------

In a forest, each rabbit has some color. Some subset of rabbits (possibly all of them) tell you how many other rabbits have the same color as them. Those `answers` are placed in an array.

Return the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest.

```
Examples:
Input: answers = [1, 1, 2]
Output: 5
Explanation:
The two rabbits that answered "1" could both be the same color, say red.
The rabbit than answered "2" can't be red or the answers would be inconsistent.
Say the rabbit that answered "2" was blue.
Then there should be 2 other blue rabbits in the forest that didn't answer into the array.
The smallest possible number of rabbits in the forest is therefore 5: 3 that answered plus 2 that didn't.

Input: answers = [10, 10, 10]
Output: 11

Input: answers = []
Output: 0
```

**Note:**

1. `answers` will have length at most `1000`.
2. Each `answers[i]` will be an integer in the range `[0, 999]`.

-------

根据`answers[i]`的数据范围，以及`answers[i]`表示的意义，分为以下几种情况：

* `answers[i]`为0，意味着颜色是独一无二的，则直接在总数里加一
* 从第二个例子可以看出，如果`answers[i]`的数值一样，那么数值相同的就可能为相同颜色的兔子，最多有`answers[i] + 1`只

所以用哈希表去记录数值为`answers[i]`的个数，当达到`answers[i] + 1`的时候，意味着这些可以“自圆其说”，于是总数增加`answers[i] + 1`，同时计数归零。最后遍历一遍哈希表，只要值不为零的，那么意味着还有一些没有回答的兔子，同样总数增加`answers[i] + 1`。

时间复杂度为$O(n)$。
