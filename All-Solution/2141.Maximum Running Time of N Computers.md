----

You have `n` computers. You are given the integer `n` and a **0-indexed** integer array `batteries` where the `ith` battery can **run** a computer for `batteries[i]` minutes. You are interested in running **all** `n` computers **simultaneously** using the given batteries.

Initially, you can insert **at most one battery** into each computer. After that and at any integer time moment, you can remove a battery from a computer and insert another battery **any number of times**. The inserted battery can be a totally new battery or a battery from another computer. You may assume that the removing and inserting processes take no time.

Note that the batteries cannot be recharged.

Return *the **maximum** number of minutes you can run all the* `n` *computers simultaneously.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2, batteries = [3,3,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
Initially, insert battery 0 into the first computer and battery 1 into the second computer.
After two minutes, remove battery 1 from the second computer and insert battery 2 instead. Note that battery 1 can still run for one minute.
At the end of the third minute, battery 0 is drained, and you need to remove it from the first computer and insert battery 1 instead.
By the end of the fourth minute, battery 1 is also drained, and the first computer is no longer running.
We can run the two computers simultaneously for at most 4 minutes, so we return 4.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/01/06/example2.png)

```
Input: n = 2, batteries = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Initially, insert battery 0 into the first computer and battery 2 into the second computer. 
After one minute, battery 0 and battery 2 are drained so you need to remove them and insert battery 1 into the first computer and battery 3 into the second computer. 
After another minute, battery 1 and battery 3 are also drained so the first and second computers are no longer running.
We can run the two computers simultaneously for at most 2 minutes, so we return 2.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= batteries.length <= 105`
- `1 <= batteries[i] <= 109`

这道题和以下问题等价：

* [AtCoder-ABC-227-D-Project Planning](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc227/tasks/abc227_d)

* 有n个数，每次从中选出`k`个数字减1，一共可以减去多少次。
* 有`a1, a2, an`共`n`组球，每组球的数量为`ai`，一个盒子可以装`k`个球，问最多可以装多少个盒子。

假设可以装`p`个盒子，那么共需要`p * k`个球，对于每组球，其可以贡献的球的数量为`min(p, ai)`，求出$\sum_{i = 1}^n \min{(a_i, P)}$，如果小于`p * k`，则不能实现，否则可以。于是可以采用二分法来进行求解。

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    long long maxRunTime(int n, vector<int>& batteries) {
        std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
        cin.tie(NULL);
        cout.tie(NULL);

        long long left = 0, right = 1e14 + 5;
        while (left < right) {
            long long mid = left + ((right - left + 1) >> 1), sum = 0;
            for (auto & e : batteries) sum += min(mid, (long long)e);
            if (sum >= (long long)n * mid) left = mid;
            else right = mid - 1;
        }

        return left;
    }
};
```
