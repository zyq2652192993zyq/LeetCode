-----

In the video game Fallout 4, the quest **"Road to Freedom"** requires players to reach a metal dial called the **"Freedom Trail Ring"** and use the dial to spell a specific keyword to open the door.

Given a string `ring` that represents the code engraved on the outer ring and another string `key` that represents the keyword that needs to be spelled, return *the minimum number of steps to spell all the characters in the keyword*.

Initially, the first character of the ring is aligned at the `"12:00"` direction. You should spell all the characters in `key` one by one by rotating `ring` clockwise or anticlockwise to make each character of the string key aligned at the `"12:00"` direction and then by pressing the center button.

At the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character `key[i]`:

1. You can rotate the ring clockwise or anticlockwise by one place, which counts as **one step**. The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of `ring`'s characters at the `"12:00"` direction, where this character must equal `key[i]`.
2. If the character `key[i]` has been aligned at the `"12:00"` direction, press the center button to spell, which also counts as **one step**. After the pressing, you could begin to spell the next character in the key (next stage). Otherwise, you have finished all the spelling.

**Example 1:**

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/ring.jpg" alt="img" style="zoom:50%;" />

```
Input: ring = "godding", key = "gd"
Output: 4
Explanation:
For the first key character 'g', since it is already in place, we just need 1 step to spell this character. 
For the second key character 'd', we need to rotate the ring "godding" anticlockwise by two steps to make it become "ddinggo".
Also, we need 1 more step for spelling.
So the final output is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: ring = "godding", key = "godding"
Output: 13
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= ring.length, key.length <= 100`
- `ring` and `key` consist of only lower case English letters.
- It is guaranteed that `key` could always be spelled by rotating `ring`.

首先看数据范围，在100左右，如果在40左右可以考虑搜索算法，在100左右基本是动态规划。

用`d[i][j]`表示让`ring`的第`j`个字符和`key`中的第`i`个字符对齐的代价，状态转移方程为：
$$
d[i][j] = \min_{\text{pos}  \in \text{record[key[i - 1]]}}{d[i - 1][pos] + \min{(\abs{\text{pos} - j}, m - \abs{\text{pos} - j}) + 1}}
$$

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int findRotateSteps(string ring, string key) {
        std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    	cin.tie(NULL);
    	cout.tie(NULL);

        int m = ring.size(), n = key.size();
        vector<vector<int>> d(n, vector<int>(m, INT_MAX / 2));

        unordered_map<char, vector<int>> record;
        for (int i = 0; i < ring.size(); ++i) record[ring[i]].push_back(i);

        for (auto & pos : record[key[0]]) {
            d[0][pos] = min(pos, m - pos) + 1;
        }

        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            for (auto & pos : record[key[i]]) {
                for (auto & pre : record[key[i - 1]]) {
                    d[i][pos] = min(d[i][pos], d[i - 1][pre] + min(abs(pos - pre), m - abs(pos - pre)) + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        return *min_element(d[n - 1].begin(), d[n - 1].end());
    }
};
```
