-----

You are given a **0-indexed** array `arr` consisting of `n` positive integers, and a positive integer `k`.

The array `arr` is called **K-increasing** if `arr[i-k] <= arr[i]` holds for every index `i`, where `k <= i <= n-1`.

- For example,

   

  ```
  arr = [4, 1, 5, 2, 6, 2]
  ```

   

  is K-increasing for

   

  ```
  k = 2
  ```

   

  because:

  - `arr[0] <= arr[2] (4 <= 5)`
  - `arr[1] <= arr[3] (1 <= 2)`
  - `arr[2] <= arr[4] (5 <= 6)`
  - `arr[3] <= arr[5] (2 <= 2)`

- However, the same `arr` is not K-increasing for `k = 1` (because `arr[0] > arr[1]`) or `k = 3` (because `arr[0] > arr[3]`).

In one **operation**, you can choose an index `i` and **change** `arr[i]` into **any** positive integer.

Return *the **minimum number of operations** required to make the array K-increasing for the given* `k`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [5,4,3,2,1], k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation:
For k = 1, the resultant array has to be non-decreasing.
Some of the K-increasing arrays that can be formed are [5,6,7,8,9], [1,1,1,1,1], [2,2,3,4,4]. All of them require 4 operations.
It is suboptimal to change the array to, for example, [6,7,8,9,10] because it would take 5 operations.
It can be shown that we cannot make the array K-increasing in less than 4 operations.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [4,1,5,2,6,2], k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation:
This is the same example as the one in the problem description.
Here, for every index i where 2 <= i <= 5, arr[i-2] <= arr[i].
Since the given array is already K-increasing, we do not need to perform any operations.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: arr = [4,1,5,2,6,2], k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
Indices 3 and 5 are the only ones not satisfying arr[i-3] <= arr[i] for 3 <= i <= 5.
One of the ways we can make the array K-increasing is by changing arr[3] to 4 and arr[5] to 5.
The array will now be [4,1,5,4,6,5].
Note that there can be other ways to make the array K-increasing, but none of them require less than 2 operations.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= arr.length <= 105`
- `1 <= arr[i], k <= arr.length`

-------

把下标位于`i, i + k, i + 2 * k ...`的数字组成一组，相当于将其变成`k`为1的序列，可以先找出最长不降子序列，用组的长度减去就是需要修改的次数。数组中的数字最多被遍历两次，最坏的情况下时间复杂度为$O(n \log n)$。

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int kIncreasing(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
        cin.tie(NULL);
        cout.tie(NULL);

        if (k == 1) return arr.size() - LIS(arr);

        int n = arr.size();
        vector<bool> used(n, false);
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        	if (! used[i]) {
        		used[i] = true;
        		vector<int> tmp{arr[i]};
        		int pos = i + k;
        		while (pos < n) {
        			used[pos] = true;
        			tmp.push_back(arr[pos]);
        			pos += k;
        		}

        		res += tmp.size() - LIS(tmp);
        	}
        }

        return res;
    }

    int LIS(vector<int> & seq) {
    	int n = seq.size();
    	vector<int> d(n + 1);
    	d[0] = INT_MIN, d[1] = 0;
    	int len = 1;
    	for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    		int target = seq[i];

    		int left = 1, right = len + 1;
    		while (left < right) {
    			int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
    			if (seq[d[mid]] <= target) left = mid + 1;
    			else right = mid;
    		}

    		if (left == len + 1) {
    			d[++len] = i;
    		}
    		else {
    			d[left] = i;
    		}
    	}

    	return len;
    }
};
