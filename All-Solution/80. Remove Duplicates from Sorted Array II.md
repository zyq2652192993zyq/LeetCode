> # 80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II

Tag: `Medium` `Array`

---

Given a sorted array *nums*, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that duplicates appeared at most *twice* and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array in-place** with O(1) extra memory.

---

**Example 1:**

```
Given nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3],

Your function should return length = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being modified to 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

```
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

**Answer:**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        if(nums.size() <= 2) return nums.size();
        int index = 2;
        for(int i = 2;i < nums.size();++i)
        {
            if(nums[i] != nums[index - 2])
                nums[index++] = nums[i];
        }
        
        return index;
    }
};
```

此种方法的可扩展性较好，当重复次数最高可为3的时候，只需要修改`index=2  nums[index-2]`的部分，将`2`替换成最多重复的次数即可



```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        int index = 0;
        
        for(int i=0;i < nums.size();++i)
        {
            if(i > 0 && i < nums.size() - 1 && nums[i] == nums[i-1] && nums[i] == nums[i+1])
                continue;
            nums[index++] = nums[i];
        }
        
        return index;
    }
};
```
