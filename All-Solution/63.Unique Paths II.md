> # 63.Unique Paths II

Tags: `Medium` `Dynamic Programming`

Links: A robot is located at the top-left corner of a *m* x *n* grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and empty space is marked as `1` and `0` respectively in the grid.

**Note:** *m* and *n* will be at most 100.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 2
Explanation:
There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePathsWithObstacles(vector<vector<int>>& obstacleGrid) {
        int m = obstacleGrid.size(), n = obstacleGrid[0].size();
        if (obstacleGrid[0][0]) return 0;
        
        vector<vector<long long>> d(m + 1, vector<long long>(n + 1));
        d[1][1] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
                if (obstacleGrid[i - 1][j - 1] || (i == 1 && j == 1)) continue;
                d[i][j] = d[i - 1][j] + d[i][j - 1];
            }
        }
        
        return d[m][n];
    }
};
```

需要注意一下，行数和列数的最大值是100，所以对应的数据量可能很大，虽然结果是`int`，但是中间过程可能会超过`int`范围，所以采用`long long`更保险。另外因为下标定义和`obstacleGrid`有区别，所以注意不要越界。
