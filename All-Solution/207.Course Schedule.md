There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses-1`.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[0,1]`

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite **pairs**, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The input prerequisites is a graph represented by **a list of edges**, not adjacency matrices. Read more about [how a graph is represented](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs).
- You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
- `1 <= numCourses <= 10^5`

这道题和210基本上思路和程序都是一致的，但是本题并不要求输出顺序结果，所以完全可以用一个计数器来代替数组，最后判断是否和课程数量相等即可。

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool canFinish(int n, vector<vector<int>>& prerequisites) { 
    	std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    	cin.tie(NULL);
    	cout.tie(NULL);

    	vector<vector<int>> grid(n);
    	vector<int> degree(n, 0);
    	int cnt = 0;

    	for (auto & e : prerequisites) {
    		int to = e[0], from = e[1];
    		grid[from].push_back(to);
    		++degree[to];
    	}

    	queue<int> q;
    	for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    		if (!degree[i]) q.push(i);
    	}

    	while (!q.empty()) {
    		int from = q.front(); q.pop();
    		++cnt;

    		for (int i = 0; i < grid[from].size(); ++i) {
    			int to = grid[from][i];
    			if (--degree[to] == 0) q.push(to);
    		}
    	}

    	return cnt == n;
    }
};
```
