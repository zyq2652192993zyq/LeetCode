---

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

**Example:**

```
Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4. 
```

**Note:**

- There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
- Your algorithm should run in O(*n2*) complexity.

**Follow up:** Could you improve it to O(*n* log *n*) time complexity?

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLIS(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.size() == 0) return 0;
        
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> d(n, 0);
        d[0] = 1;

        for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j){
        	int maxLength = 0;
        	for (int i = 0; i < j; ++i){
        		if (nums[i] < nums[j] && maxLength < d[i])
        			maxLength = d[i];
        	}
        	d[j] = maxLength + 1;
        }

        return *max_element(d.begin(), d.end());
    }
};
```
