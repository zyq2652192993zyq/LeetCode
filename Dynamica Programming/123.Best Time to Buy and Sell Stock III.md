Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most *two* transactions.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        if (prices.size() < 2) return 0;
        
        int n = prices.size();
        vector<int> f(n, 0), g(n, 0);
        int minPrice = prices[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i){
            minPrice = min(minPrice, prices[i]);
            f[i] = max(f[i - 1], prices[i] - minPrice);
        }
        
        int peak = prices[n - 1];
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i){
            peak = max(peak, prices[i]);
            g[i] = max(g[i + 1], peak - prices[i]);
        }
        
        int profit = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            profit = max(profit, f[i] + g[i]);
        
        return profit;
    }
};
```

相当于把区间分成两段，两段内各自采取只允许交易一次的方法来求取最大利润。两端区间的边界允许重合，重合情况下，左端边界肯定表示卖出，右端边界表示买入，发生在同一天则表示不交易，那么最后计算的结果就和区间只分成一段一样。

扩展一下，如果允许交易三次呢？相当于把区间分成三段，需要三个数组来存储信息。
