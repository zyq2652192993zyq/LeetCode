------

In a country popular for train travel, you have planned some train travelling one year in advance. The days of the year that you will travel is given as an array `days`. Each day is an integer from `1` to `365`.

Train tickets are sold in 3 different ways:

- a 1-day pass is sold for `costs[0]` dollars;
- a 7-day pass is sold for `costs[1]` dollars;
- a 30-day pass is sold for `costs[2]` dollars.

The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel. For example, if we get a 7-day pass on day 2, then we can travel for 7 days: day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of `days`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 11
Explanation: 
For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 1.
On day 3, you bought a 7-day pass for costs[1] = $7, which covered days 3, 4, ..., 9.
On day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 20.
In total you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 17
Explanation: 
For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs[2] = $15 which covered days 1, 2, ..., 30.
On day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2 which covered day 31.
In total you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.
```

**Note:**

1. `1 <= days.length <= 365`
2. `1 <= days[i] <= 365`
3. `days` is in strictly increasing order.
4. `costs.length == 3`
5. `1 <= costs[i] <= 1000`

用`d[i]`代表前`i`项所需的最少花费，除了0以外都用一个较大数进行初始化。因为`j`最多遍历30项，所以时间复杂度$O(n)$。

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int mincostTickets(vector<int>& days, vector<int>& costs) {
        std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
        cin.tie(NULL);
        cout.tie(NULL);

        int n = days.size();
        vector<int> d(n + 1, 365000);
        d[0] = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            for (int j = i; j >= 1; --j) {
                if (days[i - 1] - days[j - 1] < 1)
                    d[i] = min(d[i], d[j - 1] + costs[0]);
                if (days[i - 1] - days[j - 1] < 7)
                    d[i] = min(d[i], d[j - 1] + costs[1]);
                if (days[i - 1] - days[j - 1] < 30)
                    d[i] = min(d[i], d[j - 1] + costs[2]);
                if (days[i - 1] - days[j - 1] >= 30) break;
            }
        }

        return d[n];
    }
};
```
