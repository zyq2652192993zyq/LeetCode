-----

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
```

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
         std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
		cin.tie(NULL);
		cout.tie(NULL);
        
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n <= 1) return n == 1 ? nums[0] : 0;
        vector<int> d(n);
        d[0] = nums[0];
        d[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1]);
        
        for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
            d[i] = max(d[i - 1], d[i - 2] + nums[i]);
        }
        return d[n - 1];
    }
};
```

用`d[i]`代表前`i`个所能抢劫到的最大财富，那么转移方程是第`i`个不抢，就是`d[i - 1]`，如果第`i`个抢了，那么就是`d[i - 2] + nums[i]`，两者取最大值，注意一下边界条件。
