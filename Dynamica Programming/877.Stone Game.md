----

Alice and Bob play a game with piles of stones. There are an **even** number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a **positive** integer number of stones `piles[i]`.

The objective of the game is to end with the most stones. The **total** number of stones across all the piles is **odd**, so there are no ties.

Alice and Bob take turns, with **Alice starting first**. Each turn, a player takes the entire pile of stones either from the **beginning** or from the **end** of the row. This continues until there are no more piles left, at which point the person with the **most stones wins**.

Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return `true` *if Alice wins the game, or* `false` *if Bob wins*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: piles = [5,3,4,5]
Output: true
Explanation: 
Alice starts first, and can only take the first 5 or the last 5.
Say she takes the first 5, so that the row becomes [3, 4, 5].
If Bob takes 3, then the board is [4, 5], and Alice takes 5 to win with 10 points.
If Bob takes the last 5, then the board is [3, 4], and Alice takes 4 to win with 9 points.
This demonstrated that taking the first 5 was a winning move for Alice, so we return true.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: piles = [3,7,2,3]
Output: true
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= piles.length <= 500`
- `piles.length` is **even**.
- `1 <= piles[i] <= 500`
- `sum(piles[i])` is **odd**.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool stoneGame(vector<int>& piles) {
    	std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    	cin.tie(NULL);
    	cout.tie(NULL);

        int n = piles.size();
        vector<int> d(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            d[i] = piles[i];
        }

        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
                d[j] = max(piles[i] - d[j], piles[j] - d[j - 1]);
            }
        }

        return d[n - 1] > 0;
    }
};
```

用`d[i][j]`表示第`i`堆到第`j`堆存在石子的时候，当前选手能比对手多拿的石子的个数，这个数字可正可负，如果`i > j`，那么无意义为0，如果`i`和`j`相等，那么只能是选择当前的石子，就是`piles[i]`，如果堆的个数大于2，那么状态转移方程为：
$$
d[i][j] = \min{(\text{piles}[i] - d[i + 1][j], \text{piles}[j] - d[i][j - 1])}
$$
因为`d[i][j]`的状态只和`d[i + 1], d[i]`有关，所以可以进行数组压缩来优化存储空间。
