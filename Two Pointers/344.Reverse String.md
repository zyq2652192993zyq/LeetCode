-----

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `char[]`.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array in-place** with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of [printable ascii characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

------

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        int n = s.size();
        int left = 0, right = n - 1;
        while (left <= right) {
            std::swap(s[left++], s[right--]);
        }
    }
};
```
