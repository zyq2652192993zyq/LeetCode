-----

There are `buckets` buckets of liquid, where **exactly one** of the buckets is poisonous. To figure out which one is poisonous, you feed some number of (poor) pigs the liquid to see whether they will die or not. Unfortunately, you only have `minutesToTest` minutes to determine which bucket is poisonous.

You can feed the pigs according to these steps:

1. Choose some live pigs to feed.
2. For each pig, choose which buckets to feed it. The pig will consume all the chosen buckets simultaneously and will take no time.
3. Wait for `minutesToDie` minutes. You may **not** feed any other pigs during this time.
4. After `minutesToDie` minutes have passed, any pigs that have been fed the poisonous bucket will die, and all others will survive.
5. Repeat this process until you run out of time.

Given `buckets`, `minutesToDie`, and `minutesToTest`, return *the **minimum** number of pigs needed to figure out which bucket is poisonous within the allotted time*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: buckets = 1000, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 60
Output: 5
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: buckets = 4, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 15
Output: 2
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: buckets = 4, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 30
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= buckets <= 1000`
- `1 <= minutesToDie <= minutesToTest <= 100`

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {
    	std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    	cin.tie(NULL);
    	cout.tie(NULL);

    	int states = minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1;
    	return ceil(log(buckets) / log(states));
    }
};
```

这道题目是经典题目判断有毒的水的变形，也就是找二进制可以表示最大的数字大于等于`buckets`即可。本题存在特殊的条件在于`minutesToTest`可以是`minutesToDie`的整数倍，也就是说可以进行分组测试，测完一组再等一组，于是状态就多了起来，假设需要`x`只猪，共有`s`中状态，那么需要$s^x \geq \text{buckets}$。

时间复杂度和空间复杂度均为$O(1)$。
