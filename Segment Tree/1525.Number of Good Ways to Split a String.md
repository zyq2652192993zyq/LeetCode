-----

You are given a string `s`, a split is called *good* if you can split `s` into 2 non-empty strings `p` and `q` where its concatenation is equal to `s` and the number of distinct letters in `p` and `q` are the same.

Return the number of *good* splits you can make in `s`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "aacaba"
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 5 ways to split "aacaba" and 2 of them are good. 
("a", "acaba") Left string and right string contains 1 and 3 different letters respectively.
("aa", "caba") Left string and right string contains 1 and 3 different letters respectively.
("aac", "aba") Left string and right string contains 2 and 2 different letters respectively (good split).
("aaca", "ba") Left string and right string contains 2 and 2 different letters respectively (good split).
("aacab", "a") Left string and right string contains 3 and 1 different letters respectively.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abcd"
Output: 1
Explanation: Split the string as follows ("ab", "cd").
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "aaaaa"
Output: 4
Explanation: All possible splits are good.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: s = "acbadbaada"
Output: 2
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`

将字符串划分为左右两部分，不允许重叠，两部分的不同字符的个数相等，可以转化为求给定区间内不同元素的个数，所以就会存在多种解法：
